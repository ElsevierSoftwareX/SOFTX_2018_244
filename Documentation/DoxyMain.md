# DPsim C++ Developer Documentation

DPsim is a solver library for power system simulation.

- It supports both the electro-magnetic transient (EMT) and dynamic phasor (DP) domain.
- It provides a Python module which can be embedded in any Python 3 application / scripts.
- It is implemented in highly-efficient C++ code.
- It supports real-time execution with time-steps up to 50 micro seconds.
- It can load models in the [Common Information Model (CIM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Information_Model_%28electricity%29) XML format.
- It can be interfaced to a variety of protocols and interfaces via [VILLASnode](http://www.fein-aachen.org/projects/villas-framework/).

## Documentation

The [user documentation](http://dpsim.fein-aachen.org/doc/development/sphinx/) has examples, build / installation instructions and covers the Python API.

The C++ [developer documentation](http://dpsim.fein-aachen.org/doc/development/doxygen/) only includes automatically generated content using Doxygen.
It is helpful to understand the general structure of the C++ DPsim core components.
